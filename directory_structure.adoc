# Tiny MLPerf Example Directory structure

A submission is for one code base for the benchmarks submitted. An org may make multiple submissions. A submission should take the form of a directory with the following structure. The structure must be followed regardless of the actual location of the actual code, e.g. in the MLPerf repo or an external code host site.

In case of submission of results for multiple systems, please use <system_desc.id> to differentiate these. System names may be arbitrary. We recognize implementatations for multiple systems of the same organization could have different dependencies on a common code base and on each other. When submitting the code, please organize the code as much as possible following a logical structure that makes it possible to reproduce the results, and accompany it with scripts and a README that explains the process. You can use multiple <implementation_id>s to structure your submission. While we do not have many examples in Tiny yet, you can refer to https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_results_v1.1/tree/main/closed for inspiration.

System names and implementation names may be arbitrary.

<division> must be one of {closed, open}.

<benchmark> must be one of {vww, ic, kws, ad}.

Here is the list of mandatory files for all submissions in any division/category. However, your submission should still include all software information and related information for results replication.

* performance_result.txt (optional, but please check in if available)
* performance_log.txt
* performance_script.async
* accuracy_results.txt (optional, but please check in if available
* accuracy_log.txt
* accuracy_script.async
* calibration or weight transformation related code if the original MLPerf models are not used
* actual models if the models are not deterministically generated
* READMEs to enable users to replicate performance results
* code which interfaces with the runner
* <system_desc_id>.json
* TinyMLPerf_v0.1_Submission_Checklist.pdf
